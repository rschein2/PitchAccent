# What Is Pitch Accent?

If you've been studying Japanese for a while and never heard of pitch accent, you're not alone. Most textbooks skip it entirely. But pitch accent is a real part of how Japanese sounds, and learning even a little about it can make a noticeable difference in comprehension and naturalness.

## The Basics

Japanese is a **pitch-accent language**. Every word has a specific pattern of high and low pitch across its syllables (mora). Unlike English, where stress involves loudness, length, and pitch all at once, Japanese pitch accent is primarily about **relative pitch** — some mora are said at a higher pitch than others.

Consider:

| Word | Reading | Accent | Pattern | Meaning |
|------|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| 箸 | はし | [1] | **H**L | chopsticks |
| 橋 | はし | [2] | L**H** | bridge |
| 端 | はし | [0] | L**H**(H) | edge |

All three are pronounced "hashi," but with different pitch patterns. The number in brackets tells you where the pitch **drops**: after the 1st mora, after the 2nd mora, or never (0 = flat/heiban, meaning pitch stays high through any following particles).

## The Four Accent Types

Japanese pitch accent follows a small set of rules. For a word with *n* mora:

### [0] Heiban (平板 — "flat")
Pitch: **L H H H ...**

The first mora is low, then everything stays high — including particles that follow. This is the most common pattern; roughly 60% of Japanese words are heiban.

Example: さくら (桜, cherry blossom) → L H H

### [1] Atamadaka (頭高 — "head-high")
Pitch: **H L L L ...**

High on the first mora, then drops and stays low.

Example: いのち (命, life) → H L L

### [2..n-1] Nakadaka (中高 — "middle-high")
Pitch: **L H ... H L L ...**

Rises after the first mora, stays high for a while, then drops somewhere in the middle.

Example: おとこ (男, man) with accent [3] → L H H L

### [n] Odaka (尾高 — "tail-high")
Pitch: **L H H ... H** (drops on particles)

Looks like heiban within the word itself, but the pitch drops on the following particle. This is how native speakers distinguish 鼻 (nose, odaka) from 花 (flower, heiban) — both はな, both LH in isolation, but 鼻が is LHL while 花が is LHH.

## Why It Matters

### 1. Comprehension
Native speakers rely on pitch to distinguish words. If you say はし with the wrong pattern, context usually saves you — but in fast speech or ambiguous sentences, pitch is the disambiguator.

### 2. Naturalness
Even when meaning isn't affected, wrong pitch sounds distinctly foreign. A flat monotone or English-style stress patterns are one of the most noticeable markers of non-native speech, more so than imperfect consonants or vowels.

### 3. It's learnable
Unlike English stress (which is largely unpredictable and must be memorized word by word), Japanese pitch accent follows regular patterns. Verbs and adjectives have systematic conjugation rules. Compound nouns follow predictable sandhi patterns. You don't need perfect pitch — just awareness of the high/low distinction.

## The First-Mora Rule

One thing that trips up learners: the first mora is almost always **different** from the second mora.

- If the word starts high (atamadaka), the second mora is low: **HL...**
- For all other patterns, the first mora is low and the second is high: **LH...**

This means you can always hear the "shape" of a word from its first two mora.

## Comparison With Other Languages

Japanese isn't alone in using pitch accent. It's a system that sits between **tone languages** (like Mandarin, where every syllable has a fixed tone) and **stress-accent languages** (like English, where stressed syllables are louder and longer).

### Other pitch-accent languages

**Swedish and Norwegian** are the most well-known European pitch-accent languages. Swedish has two "word accents" — accent 1 and accent 2 — that distinguish otherwise identical words. The classic example: *anden* means "the duck" with accent 1 but "the spirit" with accent 2. Like Japanese, this involves melodic contour rather than loudness.

**Serbo-Croatian** has a four-way distinction: short-falling, short-rising, long-falling, long-rising — combined with which syllable carries the accent. This is more complex than Japanese but follows the same basic principle.

**Basque**, **Punjabi**, and **Ancient Greek** are also described as pitch-accent languages, though each works somewhat differently.

**Korean** historically had pitch accent (and some dialects like Gyeongsang Korean still do), which is interesting given Korean's other structural similarities to Japanese. Standard Seoul Korean lost its pitch distinctions, but recordings from the 1950s still show them.

### How Japanese differs from tone languages

In **Mandarin Chinese**, each syllable independently carries one of four tones (plus a neutral tone). Changing the tone of any syllable changes the word. In Japanese, pitch is a property of the **whole word** — you only need to know where the drop occurs (if it does), and the rest follows automatically. This makes Japanese pitch accent significantly simpler to learn than Chinese tones.

### How Japanese differs from stress languages

In **English**, stress involves multiple cues: the stressed syllable is louder, longer, and higher-pitched, while unstressed vowels get reduced (compare the two "a" sounds in "banana"). Japanese has none of this — all mora are roughly equal in length and loudness. The only variable is relative pitch. This is why Japanese learners of English struggle with vowel reduction, and why English speakers tend to impose stress patterns on Japanese where they don't belong.

## Getting Started

You don't need to master pitch accent overnight. A practical starting point:

1. **Learn the pattern types** — just knowing that [0], [1], [2], etc. exist is the first step
2. **Listen for the drop** — when hearing Japanese, try to notice where pitch falls
3. **Start with common words** — get the pitch right on the 100 most frequent words and you'll cover a large share of everyday speech
4. **Practice minimal pairs** — words like 雨/飴 (あめ [1] vs [0]) train your ear to hear the difference
5. **Don't stress about it** — even partial awareness of pitch accent improves pronunciation significantly
