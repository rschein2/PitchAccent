## 1. Origins of the NHK Accent Dictionary
The NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent Dictionary – often called the NHK Accent Dictionary – was first published in 1943 (Showa 18) during World War II. This inaugural edition was compiled by NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) as a reference to standardize Japanese pronunciation, especially pitch accent, for broadcasting purposes.[^1] Prior to this, Japan had no single authoritative guide to “correct” accent: regional dialects varied widely, and only a few academic accent glossaries existed (none comprehensive or widely adopted). In the early 20th century, as radio gained popularity, there was a growing call for a “representative” standard Japanese accent to facilitate clear nationwide communication. Linguist Haruhiko Kindaichi noted that dialectal differences (e.g. Tokyo vs. Kansai pitch patterns) often caused mutual unintelligibility, and even foreign learners were frustrated by inconsistent pronunciation norms across teachers.[^2] Establishing a standardized accent was seen as vital – not to declare other dialects “wrong,” but to provide a common reference point for public communication. In this climate, NHK – as the national broadcaster – took on the role of defining a normative Tokyo-style accent for spoken Japanese on air. The result was the 1943 NHK accent dictionary, which codified the pitch accent of 標準語 (“standard language,” essentially the Tokyo Yamanote dialect) as the model to follow. This first edition laid the groundwork for what NHK considered correct pronunciation, giving broadcasters and educators a consistent guide in an era when uniformity in spoken language was increasingly valued.[1][2]
What was the linguistic landscape of 1940s Japan regarding “correct” pronunciation? In the 1940s, “standard Japanese” (標準語) had been established in schools for grammar and vocabulary, but pitch accent remained largely unstandardized in education. People typically spoke in their local accents, and there was skepticism about elevating any one regional accent as “correct.” Kindaichi himself opposed the notion that “only Tokyo’s speech is correct and other dialects are wrong,” calling such Tokyo-centric attitudes unpleasant.[3] Nevertheless, practical needs were pressing: radio broadcasts in different local accents sounded like multiple languages to listeners, and the absence of a standard accent caused confusion. The government’s National Language Council (国語審議会) at the time focused on standardizing vocabulary and kanji, leaving accent variation largely unaddressed. Thus, NHK’s initiative filled a gap. The 1943 dictionary (titled 日本語アクセント辭典) compiled some 12,500 entries (including common words and proper nouns) with their recommended Tokyo-style pitch accent patterns.[^3] In its preface, NHK emphasized “アクセントの統一” (“unification of accent”) as essential, noting that interest had shifted from written language to spoken language, and that broadcast language in the Showa era demanded consistent pronunciation standards[4]. In short, NHK created the accent dictionary to serve as the national standard for pronunciation, ensuring that newsreaders from Hokkaido to Kyushu would use the same accent patterns for clarity and credibility.
## 2. Methodology: How NHK Determines “Correct” Accent
How does NHK decide the “correct” accent for each word? Over the decades, NHK’s methodology has combined linguistic research, expert consensus, and empirical surveys – with an increasing emphasis on actual usage data in recent editions. In the early days, the editors (linguists at the NHK Broadcasting Culture Research Institute) relied on the traditional Tokyo accent patterns as described by scholars and on the speech of NHK announcers regarded as model speakers. The goal was somewhat prescriptive: to define the standard accent that broadcasters should use. For each entry (word), the dictionary would indicate a single preferred accent pattern (in 1943 and 1966 often only one “correct” pattern was given). Words were assumed to follow the Tokyo high–low pitch rules (e.g. an accent nucleus where pitch falls, vs. accentless patterns). If multiple pronunciations existed, editors typically chose one as standard based on educated Tokyo speech norms or majority usage among professionals.
Over time, NHK adopted a more data-driven approach. NHK conducts large-scale surveys of its announcers and other speakers to inform each revision. For instance, in preparation for the 2016 edition, NHK carried out an extensive “accent survey” of 3,021 words, with 471 NHK announcers responding on how they pronounce those words.[^4] The results revealed where the dictionary’s prescribed norms diverged from actual usage. NHK researchers categorized cases of misalignment, such as: (1) words where the dictionary’s listed accent pattern had low support (few announcers actually used it), (2) words where a widely-used accent pattern was not listed in the dictionary at all, and (3) words where an alternate pattern was common but was not labeled as the primary “recommendation.”[5] These findings directly impacted the new edition’s content. In short, NHK’s policy today is a mix of prescriptivism and descriptivism: they aim to present the accent most commonly used in NHK broadcasts as the primary standard, while increasingly acknowledging variant accents that are in wide use.
Expert Panels and Corpus Data: The NHK Accent Dictionary is edited by NHK’s Broadcasting Culture Research Institute (放送文化研究所), often in collaboration with veteran announcers and linguists. Historically, editors like Shirō Kindaichi and Kazue Akinaga (though Akinaga later edited a separate dictionary) were involved. The methodology has not been explicitly published in detail for each edition, but NHK sources indicate a combination of approaches. Firstly, they draw on corpus data: NHK has vast archives of broadcast audio and transcripts, which provide evidence of how words are spoken on air. Modern editions likely reference frequency of variants in these corpora. Secondly, announcer training feedback is used – NHK’s training department notes words that frequently trip up new announcers or where accent usage is unstable, flagging them for review. Thirdly, surveys and questionnaires: as mentioned, NHK directly surveys announcers on preferred pronunciations. This was done notably in the late 1990s and again in the 2000s to capture generational shifts. The results guide which accent is marked as “第一” (primary) and which as “第二” (alternate). For example, during the 1998 revision process, NHK found that younger announcers were increasingly using flat (ベだ) patterns for many loanwords, prompting changes in the dictionary.[^5]
Handling Multiple Acceptable Accents: Unlike early editions that often listed only one “correct” accent per word, the dictionary now frequently lists multiple accent variants for a single entry when more than one is considered acceptable in standard usage. Entries with 揺れ (variation) show each possible pattern, usually separated by “・” or by numbering (①, ② etc.). All listed variants are considered within the standard’s acceptable range.[^6] Typically the first-listed accent is the one NHK deems most common or preferable at the time of publication, and the secondary variants are also allowed pronunciations.[6] For instance, a word like 「雨」 (“ame” – meaning rain) might be listed as 「アメ¹」 (with accent on the first mora: áme, high-low) and also 「アメ²」 (accentless flat ame, low-high) if both patterns are heard among Tokyo speakers.[^7] NHK’s general approach is that if a variant has significant usage among educated speakers or announcers, it should be documented rather than ignored. Indeed, the number of entries with multiple listed accents has increased with each revision, reflecting a more descriptive stance in recent years[7]. This acknowledges natural variation while still guiding users toward the most common pattern.
Loanwords (外来語) Policy: Loanwords present special challenges, as their accent patterns often fluctuate over time. NHK’s policy on gairaigo has evolved as Japanese usage has changed. In earlier editions, loanwords were often assigned an accent pattern that fit the standard Tokyo accent rules (frequently a 中高型 pattern where the accent falls in the middle, or an 頭高型 if the word began with a stressed syllable in the source language). However, as “accent flattening” became common – especially among younger speakers – NHK has adapted. A clear example is 「トレーナー」 (“trainer,” which can mean a sweat-shirt or a coach): in the 1985 edition, both meanings of トレーナー were given the same accent – トレーナー (high on “re” then down) – an orthodox pattern at the time.[^8] But by the 1990s, many speakers (particularly youth) began pronouncing トレーナー flat*, with no drop – especially for the clothing sense. The 1998 edition responded to this change: it added the heiban (flat) pronunciation 「トレーナー」 as a primary accepted accent for “trainer” (sweatshirt), based on survey results that showed a strong trend toward flattening[8]. Generally, NHK now investigates loanword accents by observing real usage: if a newer accent variant becomes mainstream, the dictionary will include it (often as an alternate at first). There is also a tendency that older loanwords (borrowed long ago) have “nativized” accent patterns, whereas newer imports may fluctuate. For instance, “ギター” (gitā – guitar) was traditionally *ギター (high-low) but many younger speakers say it flat as ギター*, and NHK now lists both. In fact, NHK research in 2016 noted that loanwords commonly used in certain domains flatten faster (e.g. tech terms, pop culture terms used daily by young people).[9] The dictionary’s 付録 (appendices) even discuss general trends, like an observation (from the 1998 edition) that “four-mora loanwords tend to be pronounced with a flat pattern up to the third mora from the end” as a default[10] – though many exceptions exist. In summary, NHK’s method combines preserving the established standard (the Tokyo NHK accent norm) with empirical adjustments** to reflect language change, especially for loanwords and new terminology.
## 3. Editions and Revisions: Major Releases and Changes
Over its history of more than 80 years, the NHK Accent Dictionary has gone through several major editions and updates. Each edition not only expanded the content (adding new words) but also updated accent prescriptions to keep up with linguistic change. Below is an overview of the major editions and what changed:
1943 – First Edition (初版): Published as 『日本語アクセント辞典』 by NHK. This was a relatively slim volume that established the Tokyo (Yamanote) pitch accent as the broadcast standard. It was compiled during WWII, so distribution was limited. The entries mostly covered common vocabulary, proper nouns, and some geographical names. The notation system in 1943 indicated high and low pitch with a combination of accent marks and superscript numbers (since the modern “downstep” symbol wasn’t in use yet). The first edition set a prescriptive tone, often listing one “correct” accent per word (usually the Tokyo form). It did not include many dialectal variations – even some Tokyo colloquialisms were omitted if deemed non-standard.[11] For example, Tokyo local slang pronunciations like 「オッコチル」 (okkochiru for “fall down”) or 「シャジ」 (shaji for saji, “spoon”) were excluded as they were considered “Tokyo dialectal” rather than standard language[12]. This edition reflected the language policy of the time: promote a uniform standard Japanese accent for the whole nation, largely based on educated Tokyo speech.
1966 – Second Edition (改訂版): After two decades (including the postwar period), NHK released a new edition in 1966 (Showa 41). This edition, edited by NHK’s Broadcasting Culture Research Institute, significantly expanded the word list and updated pronunciations to post-war standard Japanese. By 1966, Japan had experienced an influx of new words (especially gairaigo like テレビ “television”, ラジオ “radio”, etc.) – these were added with their standard accents. The 1966 dictionary also started acknowledging some alternate pronunciations in footnotes or parentheses. Accent notation was standardized, often using a downstep marker “＼” to show where the pitch falls. For example, a word might be shown as 「ア＼メ」 to indicate a drop after “a”. This edition was larger (several thousand entries) and became a trusted resource for schools and media. It cemented the dictionary’s reputation “since the first edition in 1943, a trusted reference”, as noted in publishing reviews.[^9] However, it was still fairly conservative: while a few variations were mentioned, the primary focus remained prescriptive – guiding people to the single NHK-approved accent for each word.
1985 – Third Edition (改訂新版): Published as NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典 改訂新版 in Showa 60. This update came 19 years after the previous one. The 1985 edition increased the entries to around 56,000 words[^10] and incorporated pronunciation changes that had occurred in the high-growth era of the 70s and 80s. Notably, new technical terms, modern place names, and katakana words were included. The editors also began systematically indicating secondary accepted accents for a larger number of entries. For instance, if a word had two common accent patterns in Tokyo (perhaps an older vs. newer variant), the dictionary might list the preferred one and then note the alternate as “※許容” (permissible). The 1985 edition also added an extensive appendix explaining accent rules, which became a valuable educational tool for students of broadcasting. Another change was refining how compound words’ accents are treated (since Japanese compounds often have predictable accent shifts). Overall, the 1985 revision responded to the gradual changes in spoken Japanese while maintaining a largely prescriptive stance (the attitude being that announcers should still adhere to the first-listed accent). Long-time NHK announcers from this era were trained strictly according to the 1985 dictionary, which became something of a Bible for broadcast pronunciation.
1998 – Fourth Edition (新版): Titled NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典 新版 (Heisei 10). This was a major update after 13 years, reflecting rapid changes in the language during the 1990s. The 1998 edition contained ~69,000 headwords, focusing on the accent most widely used in broadcasting at the time[13]. One of the biggest shifts in this edition was acknowledging the pitch accent changes in many common words – especially the trend of younger generations flattening traditionally accented words. For example, as mentioned, 「トレーナー」(trainer) for a sweatshirt had its flat accent added in 1998, whereas previous editions only listed the falling accent[8]. Similarly, words like 「ビデオ」 (bideo – video) and 「美人」 (bijin – beautiful woman) – which older speakers pronounced with an accent drop (ビ＼デオ, ビ＼ジン) – were increasingly said in a flat pattern by younger speakers. The 1998 dictionary responded by listing more of these variant accents as acceptable. It also greatly expanded proper nouns: major place names (cities, towns, geographical features) and personal names were added or elaborated. (Earlier editions omitted many, partly to avoid regional accent issues, but by 1998 it was seen as necessary to include them for broadcasters). Another feature of the 1998 edition was clearer notation: it used a combination of superscript accent numbers and downstep symbols, and introduced marks for accented syllables. The entry layout was improved for readability, and usage notes were added for tricky words. In short, the 1998 revision was a turning point toward a more descriptive approach, prompted by evidence from surveys that many NHK announcers were no longer strictly following the old prescribed accents.[^11] This edition continued to build the dictionary’s authority – by 2014 it had been reprinted 48 times, attesting to its widespread use[14].
2016 – Sixth Edition, “New Dictionary” (新辞典): After 18 years, NHK published the NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典 in May 2016. (This is counted as the 6th edition since 1943 by NHK’s reckoning.[^12]) The 2016 revision was the most extensive overhaul in the dictionary’s history, often referred to as the “New Accent Dictionary.” Several major changes characterize this edition:
Updated Content: It grew to about 75,000 headwords, adding 6,000 new entries compared to the ’98 edition[15][16]. Many of these new entries were contemporary words (e.g. スマホ “smartphone”, ブログ “blog”), up-to-date place names, and modern personal names, as well as more katakana loanwords that had become commonplace. The editors also enriched the coverage of counters and classifier words – the appendix on counters (助数詞) was expanded to list accent patterns for numerous numeral+counter combinations (reflecting how people actually say things like “二十歳 (hatachi)” or “三人 (san-nin)”).[^13] Lesser-used counters were removed if they had no accent variation and were rarely heard, while new ones were added based on a 2011 usage survey to ensure relevance.[^14]
Accent Variants and Notation: The 2016 edition made a bold decision to include far more accent variants for each entry and treat them more neutrally. Instead of relegating alternates to footnotes, many words now have multiple numbered accent patterns listed on equal footing. For example, a word like 「かなり」 (kanari – “quite/rather”) might show both カ＼ナリ and カナリ (flat), indicating that both are in widespread use. The print notation system was also changed: accent symbols were redesigned – a new scheme using a bold wedge mark 【^】 or similar was introduced to mark the accent nucleus, replacing the older “downstep arrow” style. (This change initially surprised some users who were used to the old notation, requiring a bit of re-learning[^15].) The redesign aimed to make the accent position visually clearer, especially when viewing small kana text, and to accommodate digital displays.
Response to Language Change: The new edition explicitly incorporated findings from NHK’s research in the 2000s. Notably, it embraced the reality that “accent leveling” (平板化) had accelerated. Words that previously had one “standard” accent now often had two or more permissible patterns. Common examples: 「ピアノ」 (piano) and 「アルバム」 (album) – traditionally pronounced ピ＼アノ, アルバ＼ム with a drop – are now so frequently said flat (ピアノ, アルバム with no drop) that the flat versions were listed as fully standard in 2016.[^16] The dictionary’s editors, like Yūdai Shioda, noted that even NHK announcers are not immune to these trends; many younger announcers naturally use the flatter patterns. By recognizing such shifts, the 2016 dictionary in effect “updated the standard” to current usage. In cases where the accent norm changed, the dictionary often still mentions the older form as an alternate (unless it has become very rare).
Additional Research and Appendices: The 2016 edition features a greatly expanded reference section. It includes detailed essays on accent rules (e.g. how compound accents work, differences in dialect accents, etc.), based on the latest linguistic research. One new addition was accent information for particles and auxiliary verbs – something the Shin Meikai accent dictionary had, but NHK’s previous editions lacked. For instance, the accent of grammatical particles like が, を, に in combination with preceding words is described in a special section (since whether a word is accented or not only becomes evident when a particle follows). This reflected a more pedagogical approach, helping even non-experts understand accent patterns.
In summary, the 2016 NHK Accent “New Dictionary” represents a shift to a balanced approach: it provides normative guidance (for broadcasters to have a standard), yet it also documents alternate pronunciations as part of the language’s evolution. The changes were widely discussed in the broadcasting and linguistics communities, which we’ll explore next.
## 4. The 2016 “New Dictionary” – Revision and Reception
The 2016 NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典 was not just a minor update but a substantial revision undertaken after nearly two decades of linguistic change. It was heralded by NHK as containing “the latest accents used in broadcasting” and was the first major revision in 18 years[17]. Let’s break down what was updated and how it was received:
Incorporation of New Research: NHK’s team prepared for the 2016 edition through years of research (some of which was serialized in NHK’s monthly journal 放送研究と調査 as an 11-part special). They analyzed large datasets – including the aforementioned 2008 announcer survey and follow-ups – to determine accent trends. One focal area was the accent of loanwords and new vocabulary, published as “The Current Status of Loanword Accent: Loanwords becoming like native words” (Bunken report, Oct 2016). Findings showed many loanwords had “default” flat patterns emerging, which were then reflected in the dictionary entries[18]. The editors also consulted the work of outside linguists (e.g. Shirō Kōri on particle accents, Fumio Inoue on dialect contact) to ensure the new edition’s accent rules were up-to-date. In essence, the 2016 dictionary was built on a much more robust empirical foundation than earlier ones. NHK openly stated that the new dictionary “contains the latest pronunciation that NHK uses on the broadcast”, emphasizing its descriptive accuracy[16].
More Accent Variants (Descriptive Flexibility): Perhaps the most noticeable change was how generously the new edition accepts variant accents. Where older editions might have listed one pattern and footnoted another, the 2016 version often lists two, three, sometimes four patterns side by side for a word, implying all are allowable. For example, 「甘い」 (amai – “sweet” or “naïve”): older dictionaries might insist on アマ＼イ (with a drop) as standard, but many speakers say アマイ (flat). The new dictionary lists both and even indicates that some NHK announcers favor the flat version for certain meanings. This approach drew both praise and criticism. Broad-minded descriptivists applauded NHK for “catching up with reality” and not stigmatizing common usage. Purists and veteran announcers, however, worried that listing too many variants could weaken the authority of the standard – essentially saying “anything goes.” One commentator observed that with each revision, the number of listed variants has grown, and expressed concern that accent standards might be becoming too lax[7]. Nonetheless, NHK’s position is that documenting variation is not the same as endorsing sloppy speech – it’s about recognizing that language changes and that the standard itself can shift over time.
Accent Notation and Design: The 2016 edition introduced a new typographic design. The cover of the book was a distinctive pink color, and inside, the accent notation was revamped. Instead of the previous “＼” mark after the accented mora, the new dictionary uses a small raised triangular mark before the syllable where pitch falls (somewhat akin to the notation in linguistic literature). This caused “驚き (surprise)” among users when it first came out, as many had to re-learn how to read the accent markings.[^15] However, NHK explained that the new notation is more precise and aligns with how pitch accent is taught in modern linguistics. The dictionary also came with audio recordings for over 100,000 words (accessible via an optional CD or digital app), a first for NHK’s accent reference. Hearing NHK announcers pronounce each entry was a huge benefit for learners and professionals, reinforcing the written accent notation with real examples.
Reception in Broadcasting Circles: Within NHK and other broadcasting organizations, the 2016 dictionary was met with a mix of excitement and caution. NHK announcers themselves largely welcomed it – many had been eagerly awaiting the update (“プロ必携…地方出身者の強い味方!!” – “a must-have for professionals… and a strong ally for those from the provinces,” as one announcer tweeted).[^17] They appreciated the inclusion of more place names (so they could confidently pronounce regional locations on air) and the acknowledgment of alternate accents that some had already been using. The term “アナウンサー必携” (“indispensable for announcers”) was frequently mentioned on social media when the book was released[19][20]. NHK’s training departments updated their curriculum to align with the new dictionary, and younger announcers felt validated that certain pronunciations they grew up with were now recognized as standard. On the other hand, some experienced announcers and speech coaches voiced reservations. They had diligently followed the older standards and felt uneasy that what was once “incorrect” was now “correct.” For instance, if for decades they were corrected to say a word one way, and suddenly the new book says another way is fine, it created some cognitive dissonance. An internal NHK survey (as reported in 放送研究と調査) collected opinions: some veterans worried that giving too many options might confuse trainees – “Shouldn’t we continue to enforce one accent pattern to maintain consistency?”, they asked. In response, the NHK editors noted that even in the past, multiple accents existed; the new dictionary just brings them to light. Commercial broadcasters (like Fuji TV, TBS, etc.) also generally adopted the NHK dictionary as their standard reference (more on this in the next section), so the influence was industry-wide.
Reception in Language Education: Japanese language educators and linguists reacted with interest. The dictionary’s release was discussed in forums, blogs, and even on Twitter and Facebook among Japanese teachers and accent enthusiasts. Many praised NHK for the depth of information – noting that the new edition’s appendices on intonation and regional accent comparison make it a valuable resource for teaching prosody. Some Japanese-as-foreign-language teachers admitted that previously they paid little attention to teaching pitch accent, but the publicity around the NHK dictionary’s revision prompted them to revisit the topic, armed with this comprehensive guide. On the flip side, a few educators argued the dictionary’s changes could be “too progressive” – for example, by accepting youthful flat accents, NHK might hasten the loss of certain distinctions (like 飴 (candy) vs 雨 (rain), which are distinguished by accent). However, overall the reception was positive: the dictionary was seen as reflecting “modern standard Japanese” as it truly is spoken, rather than freezing the language in mid-20th century.
In summary, the 2016 NHK New Accent Dictionary was a major revision that updated the standard to the 21st century. It managed to incorporate new research findings, list multiple accent variants (where appropriate), and expand its utility – all while still serving as the guiding norm for broadcasters. Its release generated healthy debate, effectively shining a spotlight on Japanese pitch accent itself – a subject often ignored in everyday language discussions.
## 5. Influence on Broadcasting: NHK and Beyond
The NHK Accent Dictionary’s primary purpose has always been to guide broadcast pronunciation, so its influence in broadcasting is profound.
NHK Announcers and “アナウンサー言葉”: NHK announcers are famously trained to speak in standard accent as prescribed by this dictionary. During their training at the NHK Broadcasting Training Center (放送研修センター), announcers spend many hours practicing reading scripts with the accent dictionary at hand. They learn アナウンサー言葉 (“announcer language”), which refers to the precise and neutral speech style expected of them – correct pitch accent, correct diction, no regional tint. The accent dictionary is essentially the curriculum for pitch accent: trainees memorize the patterns of commonly used words and learn to apply general accent rules for unfamiliar words by analogy. How strictly do they follow it? – Very strictly, especially in formal contexts like news. NHK has internal evaluators and speech coaches who monitor broadcasts; if an announcer deviates from the standard accent in a news report, it’s often noted and corrected. Historically, NHK maintained a near-pedantic adherence to the dictionary. Veteran announcers like Morio Kita (fictional example) would even recall being scolded for a single accent mistake on air. That said, as noted earlier, actual usage by announcers can drift subtly over time (which is why NHK surveys them). The 2016 edition’s findings indicated that even among NHK newsreaders, some traditional accents had given way to newer patterns[21]. But once the new standard is set by the dictionary, NHK announcers adjust their speech to conform. In essence, the dictionary both reflects and shapes NHK speech – it is based on announcer usage, and once published, it becomes the rulebook announcers must follow going forward.
For example, if the dictionary now lists 「ネット」 (netto – “internet”) as ネット◎ (accentless) whereas perhaps 20 years ago it might have been ネ＼ット, then NHK announcers will unify on the accentless pronunciation. Consistency is key: listening to NHK News, one will notice that announcers from all regions sound remarkably similar in accent and intonation – that is the NHK accent standard in action[2]. This uniformity, sometimes called “NHK Japanese,” has even been subject to parody for its extreme neutrality.
Commercial Broadcasters: Do other TV/radio stations follow the same standard? Generally, yes. NHK’s accent dictionary is considered the de facto standard across Japan’s broadcasting industry. Announcers and newscasters at commercial stations (Nippon TV, TBS, Fuji TV, TV Asahi, etc.) often come from the same university backgrounds or have taken the same speech training courses as NHK announcers. Many of those courses and manuals explicitly use NHK’s dictionary as the reference. In fact, some commercial broadcasters purchase NHK’s dictionary in bulk for their announcer staff. The phrase “標準アクセント” (standard accent) will usually imply “as in NHK’s accent dictionary” unless otherwise specified. That said, enforcement may be a bit more relaxed outside NHK. NHK, as the public broadcaster, feels a strong responsibility to uphold the standard, whereas a local commercial station in Osaka, for instance, might tolerate a hint of Kansai accent in a lifestyle segment or variety show. Even so, for national network news broadcasts on commercial TV, you’ll notice the speech is virtually indistinguishable from NHK’s – a testament to NHK’s standard’s reach.
One area of slight divergence: Proper names and local terms. Commercial stations sometimes deliberately use local accent for local names to appeal to regional pride (for example, an Osaka-based station might pronounce 大阪 as “おおさ↗か” – Kansai accent – in a local commercial). NHK would stick to “お↘おさか” (Tokyo accent) universally. By and large, though, the NHK accent standard is respected. It’s worth noting that older generation announcers in commercial TV (say those who started in the 1970s–80s) were trained with the 1985 or 1998 editions. Some of them occasionally use an accent that the 2016 edition has updated. This can lead to differences between an older anchor and a younger reporter on the same program. However, these are minor and rarely noticed by the general public.
Announcer Training Procedures: Both NHK and other broadcasters invest in training their announcers in pronunciation. Trainees practice by reading news scripts out loud and comparing their accent with the dictionary’s guidance. There are even pronunciation drills – for example, tongue twisters and minimal pairs that differ only by accent (like 箸 (háshi, chopsticks) vs 橋 (hashí, bridge) vs 端 (hashi, edge) – three words distinguished solely by pitch). Trainees must learn these distinctions to avoid embarrassing ambiguities on air. NHK’s training manuals instruct announcers to consult the accent dictionary whenever they are unsure about a word’s accent, and to annotate their scripts with accent markings. In live broadcasts, announcers mentally refer to this training. There’s a famous concept of “アナウンサー敬語・アナウンサーアクセント” – the idea that announcers have a somewhat stylized way of speaking (including accent) that sounds polite, clear, and a bit formal. Adhering to the accent dictionary is part of that professionalism. An interesting phenomenon is that some NHK announcers from regions like Kansai or Tohoku essentially re-train themselves to speak with Tokyo accent to the point that even off-camera they maintain it. The dictionary is their constant companion in that transformation.
“アナウンサー言葉” vs Natural Speech: While the NHK standard accent is considered correct and is expected in news and official announcements, some critics say it can sound “stiff” or “unnatural”. This is especially said of scripted speech that strictly follows all rules. For instance, technically correct accent might conflict with colloquial patterns. An NHK narrator might pronounce 「ありがとう」 (thank you) with the textbook accent アリガ↘トウ, whereas many regions (and young people in Tokyo) say アリガトー (flat) in casual speech. Such differences are subtle, but some listeners perceive the NHK style as distinct. Nonetheless, credibility and clarity in broadcasting are thought to be enhanced by sticking to the standard accent. There’s an implicit trust: if an announcer uses the proper accent, it signals they are well-trained and authoritative.
In summary, the NHK accent dictionary’s influence on broadcasting is pervasive. NHK announcers rigorously follow it – it defines their speech – and commercial broadcasters largely emulate the NHK standard. The result is that across Japan’s airwaves, newscasters speak in a homogenized accent that traces back to NHK’s work. As the Japanese Pitch Accent article on Wikipedia notes, “Newsreaders and other speech professionals are required to follow these standards” set by NHK and the Shin Meikai accent dictionaries[22]. This standardization is so effective that many Japanese viewers might not even realize how diverse accents truly are – until they step outside the studio and hear regional speakers.
## 6. Influence on Language Education
Beyond broadcasting, the NHK Accent Dictionary has also impacted language education, both for native Japanese speakers and for learners of Japanese as a foreign language.
In Japanese Schools (Native Education): Surprisingly, pitch accent is not explicitly taught in the standard Japanese school curriculum. In compulsory education (elementary through high school), national language classes focus on reading, writing, grammar, and standard vocabulary. The accent with which students speak is generally left to their environment – a student in Tokyo will naturally speak with Tokyo pitch accent, while one in Aomori will have a Tohoku intonation, etc. There isn’t a unit in textbooks like “Correct Accent Patterns” for Japanese words. As Kindaichi pointed out, written language was standardized nationally, but spoken accent was not mandated in schools[23]. The assumption was that children would adopt standard accent if needed by moving to Tokyo or through media exposure. That said, high school Japanese language clubs (e.g. broadcasting clubs, speech contest teams) do make use of the accent dictionary. Students in an announcers’ club or those training for speech competitions refer to it to improve their pronunciation. The 1998 edition, for example, was reportedly used by school broadcasting clubs and their coaches as a reference[24]. So, while not in mainstream curriculum, the NHK accent standard trickles down to students involved in media, theater, or language arts. Additionally, Japanese singing and acting coaches sometimes reference pitch accent for proper enunciation in lyrics or lines – indirectly drawing from the NHK standard.
Japanese as a Foreign Language (日本語教育 for non-natives): In the realm of teaching Japanese to foreigners, pitch accent historically received relatively little attention compared to grammar and vocabulary. Many popular textbooks (especially older ones) ignored it, and proficiency tests like the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) do not test pitch accent explicitly. A learner could pass JLPT N1 (the highest level) and still have non-standard or inconsistent pitch accent; the test doesn’t penalize that. However, in recent years there’s been growing awareness of the importance of pitch accent for attaining native-like fluency. The NHK Accent Dictionary has become an invaluable resource for advanced learners and teachers aiming to teach correct pronunciation. For instance, some Japanese language programs now include a unit on pitch accent using tools like the OJAD (Online Japanese Accent Dictionary) or other materials (more on OJAD in the next section). These often cross-reference NHK’s data.
Japanese teachers might use NHK’s dictionary to prepare pronunciation notes for students, especially for minimal pairs where accent matters. Example: to teach the difference between 「雨」 (あめ – rain) and 「飴」 (あめ – candy), a teacher can point out that according to the accent dictionary, 「雨」 is accent pattern [アメ]{HL} (high then low) and 「飴」 is [アメ]{LH} (low then high), so that’s how native speakers tell them apart. Such information helps students avoid misunderstandings. Furthermore, accent dictionaries have been used in creating pronunciation training software for learners. The NHK 2016 edition came with audio by NHK announcers, which is a treasure trove for learners who want to hear standard accent used consistently. Some Japanese language schools encourage students (particularly at advanced levels or those training to be Japanese teachers) to consult the NHK accent dictionary when in doubt about pronunciation.
Despite these uses, it’s important to note that most foreign learners are still not required to master pitch accent unless they aim for fields like interpretation, broadcasting, or academia. A casual learner may speak Japanese intelligibly with incorrect accents on many words – Japanese is generally intelligible even with accent errors, because context helps. (In fact, it’s often said that pitch accent errors by foreigners sound “cute” or at worst cause minor confusion, unlike a stress error in English which might make a word unrecognizable.) This has led many instructors to de-emphasize pitch accent to avoid overwhelming beginners. However, at the very high end (near-native or professional level), pitch accent becomes a distinguishing factor. Here, the NHK Accent Dictionary is the gold standard. Non-native professionals like news announcers on NHK World (the international service) or advanced speech contest winners often train with it to polish their accent. Some have described the process as analogous to how non-native English broadcasters work on their pronunciation – the NHK dictionary is like the “Received Pronunciation guide” for Japanese.
Interestingly, outside Japan, resources based on NHK’s accent data are being used in academia. Researchers in computational linguistics and speech technology incorporate the NHK lexicon’s accent information (and also data from UniDic) to create text-to-speech systems or to analyze Japanese prosody. For example, a project might use the NHK dictionary’s marking to ensure a speech synthesizer places the pitch drop correctly for each word in synthesized newsreadings.
Summary in Education: In Japanese schools, the influence of the NHK accent standard is indirect but present in extracurricular activities and media exposure. In Japanese-as-a-foreign-language education, the influence is growing – the NHK dictionary provides a reference for correct accent that serious students and teachers can rely on. As more learners strive for native-like pronunciation (fueled in part by internet content and communities discussing pitch accent), NHK’s work becomes ever more relevant. It’s now common to find Japanese learning resources citing “according to the NHK accent dictionary, word X is heiban (flat) while word Y is atamadaka (head-high).” In sum, while pitch accent remains a somewhat niche aspect of language education, the NHK Accent Dictionary is the authoritative source for those who do venture into mastering this aspect of Japanese.
## 7. Controversies and Criticisms
No influential language standard comes without controversy, and the NHK Accent Dictionary is no exception. Over the years, several debates and criticisms have emerged regarding its approach and impact:
Prescriptivism vs. Descriptivism: A fundamental criticism is that the NHK dictionary (especially early editions) was overly prescriptive – essentially telling people how they should speak, based on an ideal Tokyo model, rather than how people do speak. Critics argue that language is alive and evolving, so codifying one “correct” accent is artificial. On the other hand, defenders point out that a broadcaster’s standard is necessary for mutual intelligibility and that the NHK dictionary in recent editions has become more descriptive (listing multiple variants, reflecting actual usage). The tension between these viewpoints is ongoing. Linguists like Haruhiko Kindaichi and Kazue Akinaga, who worked on accent dictionaries, themselves discussed that NHK’s dictionary serves a different purpose than a purely descriptive accent dictionary – NHK’s is a “nationwide common language accent” guide for broadcast, whereas something like the Shin Meikai aims to document even slang and local Tokyo variants[11]. Thus, some argue the two types shouldn’t be conflated. Still, purists feel NHK might be capitulating to change too much (descriptive at the cost of a clear standard), while others feel it was too rigid for too long.
Regional Pride and “Wrong” Accents: Speakers of regional dialects sometimes feel that the NHK standard marginalizes their speech, effectively labeling their natural accents as “incorrect.” For instance, someone from Osaka might pronounce 大阪 as おおさ↗か (no drop, rising on “さ”) which is normal in Osaka (Kansai accent), but the NHK dictionary prescribes お↘おさか (drop after “お”) as standard. If that Osakan becomes an NHK announcer, they must adopt the Tokyo pattern – implying their native accent is “wrong” for official purposes. This has occasionally led to public commentary, especially when accents become identity issues. A recent example involved the pronunciation of 「天王寺」 (Tennoji, an area in Osaka) in a TV drama: the actors used Tokyo-style accent, and many Kansai viewers complained “They’re saying it wrong!” on social media[25][26]. Linguists explained that Tokyo accent cannot replicate the local Osaka pitch for “Tennoji” (the patterns don’t align), so the actors chose the closest standard Tokyo pattern – but to locals it sounded jarring[27]. This highlights a broader controversy: whose accent is “correct”? For national broadcasts, Tokyo accent has been chosen as the standard, but that’s a convention – not an inherent truth. Some have called for greater acceptance of dialectal accents in media, rather than forcing everything into Tokyo pitch patterns. NHK has somewhat softened in entertainment programs (you’ll hear dialects in dramas or variety shows), but in news the Tokyo standard reigns. The debate is similar to those in other countries about regional dialects in national media (e.g., regional English accents on the BBC).
Words vs. Usage – When the Dictionary Lags: There have been cases where the dictionary’s prescribed accent did not match actual Tokyo usage, causing confusion or criticism. For example, prior to 2016, the dictionary might have still listed an older accent for a word even after many Tokyoites had switched to a new one. One such case: 「現実味」 (genjitsumi meaning “sense of reality”). It was long listed with accent ゲンジツミ↘ (drop on “mi”), but by 2010s many people said ゲンジツミ (flat). NHK’s own survey found “現実味” accentless had 100% support among respondents despite not being in the old dictionary[28]. Situations like this (where the “非掲載型” – unlisted form – is actually common) make the dictionary seem out-of-touch. The 2016 revision aimed to catch up on many of these, but language change is constant. Critics from the descriptive camp say NHK should update more frequently or use corpus data continuously to avoid such gaps. Conversely, some conservative voices criticize when NHK does change a prescription. They might say, “Why did NHK change the accent of XYZ in the new edition? Hardly anyone says it that way!” – implying NHK might be leading change, not just following it. In truth, NHK usually waits until a variant is very common before recognizing it, but perception varies.
Marked Intonation vs. Naturalness: Some speakers feel that strictly following the NHK accent norms can sometimes sound “marked” or unnatural in casual contexts. For example, the dictionary might insist on a distinction that everyday folks often neutralize. One oft-cited example: 「じゃない」 (janai, “is not”). In standard Tokyo accent, when used in a casual tag-question (“…じゃない?” meaning “…, isn’t it?”), many people say it flat or with a non-standard intonation. An announcer, however, might carefully pronounce it as ジャ↘ナイ to keep the accent pattern of the phrase consistent. Listeners occasionally remark that such pronunciations sound “NHK-ish” (アナウンサーっぽい) – a bit too refined for normal conversation. This has led to a minor criticism that the NHK dictionary promotes a style of speech that, while clear, might lack the natural prosodic flow of spontaneous conversation. NHK’s counter-argument is that broadcasting is not casual chatting – clarity and correctness take precedence over colloquial feel. Yet this tension between standard vs. natural variation is at the heart of some controversies. Younger audiences sometimes prefer newscasters with a “softer” accent (not broad dialect, but not overly formal Tokyo either), and some stations have experimented with that – but NHK largely has not.
Public Reactions and Media Debates: Each time the dictionary is revised, Japanese media and forums buzz with opinions. After the 2016 新辞典 came out, NHK’s own publications compiled reactions from professional users on blogs and Twitter. They found a mix of positive feedback and critical comments, as detailed in the final installment of their report series[29]. Positive reactions praised the increased user-friendliness and the fact that NHK was listening to actual usage (“現代のアクセント辞典!” – “truly a modern accent dictionary,” wrote one announcer)[^17]. Negative reactions included things like: “Why list so many variants? It feels like the standard is becoming vague.” or “They changed the accent of [XYZ word]; I learned it the old way – was I wrong, or did the standard change overnight?”. Indeed, some people tongue-in-cheek blamed the dictionary for “legitimizing the lazy speech of youth.” On the flip side, dialect speakers sometimes comment, “Well, my accent still isn’t in there – everything is judged by Tokyo, as usual.” These criticisms reflect the inherent challenge: you can’t please everyone with a standard**. The dictionary is pulled between being a stable standard and an evolving record.
To illustrate a few specific contested examples that often come up in criticisms, consider the following cases (showing how the prescribed accent has changed or been debated):
「箸 vs 橋 vs 端」 – (hashi: chopsticks vs bridge vs edge). In standard Tokyo, these are a classic minimal trio: 箸 (háshi) is accent #1 (high-low), 橋 (hashí) is accent #2 (low-high), 端 (hashi) is accent #0 (flat). The accent dictionary has long taught this distinction as a cornerstone of Tokyo accent. However, outside of careful speech, some speakers merge one of these (e.g., some might pronounce 橋 the same as 端 in fast speech). Critics argue that such fine distinctions matter mostly in artificial examples and that context usually prevents confusion – so is it worth drilling them? The counterpoint is yes, for broadcasters it is worth it, to avoid any ambiguity. This debate is essentially prescriptive vs descriptive in microcosm.
「彼女」 (kanojo, “she/girlfriend”). NHK dictionaries traditionally listed か↘のじょ (accent on “ka”), as that was considered standard. But a lot of people, especially younger, say かのじょ (flat) in practice. The 2016 dictionary added the flat as an acceptable variant. Some older speakers grumbled – to them かのじょ (flat) sounded “incomplete” or Kansai-like. Language evolves, though; the variant arose perhaps by analogy with other pronouns that are flat. Here, NHK’s move to include it was viewed by descriptivists as welcome, but by purists as an unnecessary concession.
「東京」 (Tōkyō, Tokyo). One might assume Tokyo must have a set standard accent, but historically 東京 had a couple of pronunciations. The NHK dictionary prescribes トウ↘キョウ (accent on “To”). However, some Tokyo natives (especially in fast speech) might say トウキョウ (flat). NHK has always favored the former for clarity (and to distinguish from similar patterns in compound names like 東京駅). This hasn’t really changed, but it’s a word people bring up when discussing how strictly NHK enforces accent: “Even our city’s name has a specific accent we must use on air.”
Flattening of loanwords: We discussed 「トレーナー」 (trainer) already. Other examples include 「マネージャー」 (manējā, manager). Older standard: マネ↘ージャー (drop at “ネ”), but now often heard flat as マネージャー. NHK 2016 lists both. Some purists think a word with a long vowel like this should have a drop (for a “down-up-down” melody) and that flat sounds “dull.” But usage won out. Similarly, 「リハーサル」 (rihāsaru, rehearsal) – originally リハ↘ーサル, now equally リハーサル flat. These changes sometimes irk those who learned one way and see youth doing another.
Words from dialects entering standard: Occasionally a word originating in Kansai dialect gains nationwide use, and accent decisions must be made. For example, 「めっちゃ」 (metcha, “very”), a Kansai slang, became popular nationally. Kansai accent for めっちゃ is flat (メッチャ), whereas Tokyo speakers at first might say メ↘ッチャ applying a Tokyo rule. Which to list? The NHK dictionary ultimately listed メッチャ◎ (flat) as it’s a fixed two-mora word often said quickly. But you can find people who’d argue about it. This touches on how regional words get integrated and standardized.
Overall, the tension between maintaining a standard and respecting natural variation is the core of controversies around the NHK Accent Dictionary. NHK walks a line: if it’s too strict, people say it’s prescriptive and unrealistic; if it’s too lax, people say the standard is eroding. The dialogue between critics and the dictionary’s editors is actually productive – as seen in NHK’s own publications, they listen and adjust (the 2016 edition being proof of responding to criticisms of the 1998 edition’s limitations). And ultimately, Japanese society seems to tacitly accept the need for a standard accent (for professional contexts) even if they debate its details. As Kindaichi eloquently put it, while he opposed declaring dialects “wrong,” he also acknowledged the “rising voice for a representative standardized Japanese” that must be answered[30]. The NHK Accent Dictionary continues to be that answer, albeit now a bit more flexibly than before.
## 8. Comparison with Other Accent Resources
The NHK Accent Dictionary is not the only resource on Japanese pitch accent. Several other dictionaries and tools exist, each with its own approach and coverage. Here we compare NHK’s dictionary with some notable accent resources: OJAD (Online Japanese Accent Dictionary), Shin Meikai/Meikai Accent Dictionaries, Daijirin (monolingual dictionary), and UniDic (lexical database).
NHK vs. Shin Meikai (新明解日本語アクセント辞典): The Shin Meikai Japanese Accent Dictionary, edited by Kazue Akinaga (with Haruhiko Kindaichi as advisor for the first edition), is often considered the main counterpart to NHK’s. The Meikai (and its predecessor Meikai/明解, first published 1981) is more academic and descriptive in nature. As Akinaga writes, the Meikai focuses on pure Tokyo accent including even slang, archaic forms, and “Tokyo dialect” quirks that NHK’s dictionary deliberately leaves out[11][31]. For example, the Meikai might include colloquial pronunciations like オッコチル or シャジ (which NHK omits as non-standard). It also covers grammatical forms extensively: the Meikai lists accent for each conjugated form of verbs and adjectives (e.g. it will show the accent for 食べる, 食べた, 食べれば, 食べろ etc.), whereas the NHK dictionary typically lists just the dictionary form or a representative conjugation and relies on the user to know the rules. Additionally, the Meikai includes many proper nouns (place names, personal names) – the latest Shin Meikai (2nd edition, 2014) has about 76,600 entries including names and literary words[32], which actually surpasses NHK’s 75,000 in pure count (though NHK might have more broadcast-relevant proper nouns). Importantly, the Shin Meikai often provides general accent rules and patterns in its introduction, aiming to educate the user on why a word has a certain accent. NHK’s dictionary, especially older editions, didn’t delve as deeply into explaining the system (that changed somewhat in 2016 with expanded appendices). One more difference: Shin Meikai sometimes marks subtle distinctions that NHK glosses over. For instance, in accent notation, the Meikai might differentiate the accent of a word when used before certain particles (since in Tokyo Japanese, a word’s accent can have effects on following particles). NHK typically just marks the word’s accent and assumes the user knows how particles behave. In sum, NHK’s dictionary is a practical broadcast standard reference, whereas Shin Meikai is a comprehensive accent “encyclopedia” of Tokyo Japanese. Many serious students and linguists use both: NHK for the authoritative broadcast standard, Meikai for additional context and historical forms. It’s telling that Kindaichi in the Meikai preface praised NHK’s dictionary for its “conscientious editing attitude” as the standard, but noted its smaller scope (no names, few grammar forms) and pitched the Meikai as filling that gap with a more user-friendly and extensive approach[33].
OJAD (Online Japanese Accent Dictionary): OJAD is a freely accessible web database developed by researchers at the University of Tokyo (GAVO project). It’s tailored for Japanese language teachers and learners. OJAD covers around 9000 nouns and 3500 verbs/adjectives, providing their Tokyo accent patterns. One key feature is that OJAD allows users to input a sentence and it will output the prosody (showing which highs and lows each word takes in context). OJAD’s data for words is largely based on NHK’s accent dictionary (2016 edition) – it uses the same accent classifications (heiban, atamadaka, etc.). However, OJAD is limited to common vocabulary and is designed as a teaching tool: it has a clear, simple display (with a graphical pitch contour line and audio) to show learners how to pronounce words in a sentence. Unlike NHK’s dictionary, OJAD doesn’t list multiple variants for a word; it will usually show the most standard pattern. For example, if a word has two possible accents, OJAD might just show the one considered more common (perhaps referencing NHK’s primary entry). The rationale is to not overwhelm learners with options. So, OJAD differs in approach: it sacrifices comprehensive coverage for pedagogical simplicity and interactive functionality. It’s extremely useful for what it does – e.g. a teacher can quickly check how to accent a verb phrase in polite form – but it’s not as authoritative or detailed as NHK’s dictionary. One advantage of OJAD is that it includes accent for verb conjugations and common phrases (based on rules, not listing each explicitly). For instance, you can see the accent for 飲まなければ (nomanakereba) or 行っちゃった (icchatta), which you’d have to infer using rules from NHK’s dictionary. OJAD doesn’t replace NHK’s dictionary for professionals, but it’s a complimentary resource geared toward learners, and the two together show the accent from different angles (NHK: reference for each word; OJAD: how to pronounce in context).
Daijirin (大辞林) and Other Monolingual Dictionaries: Standard Japanese dictionaries like Daijirin (Sanseidō) or Daijisen (Shogakukan) are not dedicated accent dictionaries, but they do include accent information for headwords. Typically, they use a numerical notation known as アクセント値 (accent value) – often a superscript number at the end of the word. For example, Daijirin might list a word as 【あめ①】 or 【あめ⓪】 to indicate its pitch accent class (with 0 meaning heiban, 1 meaning accent on first mora, etc.). These numbers correspond to the Tokyo accent pattern classification. The information in these dictionaries tends to align with the NHK standard because they aim to reflect common (usually Tokyo) pronunciation. However, they may not be as up-to-date or consistent as the NHK dictionary for certain words. Also, general dictionaries usually list only one accent pattern per word (the most common or standard one), and rarely note variants unless it’s a very widespread alternate. So, if a word has recently started shifting accent, a monolingual dictionary might not show that – whereas the NHK accent dictionary likely would, if it’s significant enough. The coverage of accent info in general dictionaries is broad (they have hundreds of thousands of entries), but the depth is shallow (just a number). By contrast, NHK’s dictionary has fewer total entries but gives a lot of detail for each (variants, usage notes, etc.). Another resource, 新明解国語辞典 (a popular monolingual dictionary, not to be confused with the accent one), interestingly does not list pitch accent at all – showing that within general dictionaries, it’s hit or miss. For everyday reference, many Japanese rely on these small accent numbers in their dictionary app or printed dictionary, but for any ambiguity or less common word, professionals will double-check with NHK’s dictionary.
UniDic (ユニディック) and Lexical Databases: UniDic is a free Japanese morphological dictionary maintained by NINJAL (National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics). It’s used in text analysis and NLP (like for MeCab morphological parser). UniDic includes a field for pitch accent type for many words. This data is often drawn from the NHK accent dictionary (1998 or 2016 editions). Essentially, UniDic encodes the accent number (or a marker for heiban) in its lexical entries. For example, an entry for 学校 (gakkō, school) in UniDic will have a code indicating it’s accent pattern 0 (flat). Researchers and technologists use this to generate accented readings of text. The approach of UniDic is purely data-driven: it doesn’t explain or list variants, it just gives what it considers the primary accent pattern for each word (again, usually matching NHK’s main listing). Comparison: UniDic is comprehensive (it has many proper nouns, place names, etc., because it’s meant for parsing text from various domains), so in terms of coverage, it may exceed NHK’s dictionary. However, UniDic’s accent info can sometimes be incomplete or not account for multiple variants; it typically lists one pattern per word. For someone working on Japanese text-to-speech, using UniDic’s accent info is a quick solution, but if high accuracy is needed (say for NHK-level pronunciation), they might still cross-reference NHK’s actual dictionary for tricky words or double-check variants. UniDic and NHK differ also in that NHK’s is human-readable and educational, while UniDic is machine-readable. UniDic doesn’t provide the rich contextual info (like “alternate accent X is also used by 30% of speakers”) – it’s just a number. Thus, UniDic relies on the research done by NHK (and others) and packages it in a different form for computational use. It’s a testament to NHK’s dictionary that its data is considered reliable enough to form the backbone of such databases.
Other Resources (Apps, etc.): There are also apps and smaller reference books on accent. For instance, “日本語アクセント入門” or “外来語アクセント辞典” by academic authors, which might target actors or learners. These usually distill content from the big dictionaries. Online communities (like the Reddit r/LearnJapanese) often refer to the NHK dictionary or OJAD when answering accent questions[6]. And some creative resources like Forvo (pronunciation database) or YouGlish (YouTube-based) can let you hear multiple people pronouncing a word – showing the variation that might exist beyond the prescriptive word. Those aren’t dictionaries, but they play a role in understanding accent in practice, which sometimes leads learners to compare with what NHK’s dictionary says.
To illustrate differences in approach and coverage, here’s an example word across resources: 「はし」 (hashi), which could mean chopsticks, bridge, or edge as we discussed. - NHK Accent Dictionary: Would have separate entries for 箸, 橋, 端 with their respective accent patterns clearly indicated, perhaps usage notes (e.g. 橋 and 端 only distinguished when a particle follows, etc.). Possibly multiple variants if any exist (in this case, likely not, since those are well-established). - Shin Meikai: Also separate entries, with maybe more historical notes. It might mention that 端 (edge) being heiban can sometimes be confused with 橋 in isolation and give examples. - OJAD: If you input “箸” or “橋”, it will show you the accent pattern in a sentence context (like “箸を使う” vs “橋を渡る”), making clear one is HAshi-o and the other is haSHI-o with the particle. Good for a learner to see the difference in context. - Daijirin: The entry for はし will have a small “①” for chopsticks, “②” for bridge, possibly “0” for edge, without much fanfare. - UniDic: Each of the three will have an accent number (箸: 1, 橋: 2, 端: 0 in some scheme). A parser using UniDic could theoretically assign the right accent in text-to-speech if it knows which kanji (hence which meaning) is intended.
In concluding this comparison: the NHK Accent Dictionary remains the authoritative source for standard pitch accent in Japanese, especially for professional and academic needs. The Shin Meikai is its complementary counterpart offering a broader descriptive lens on Tokyo accent (and is often cited in linguistic research alongside NHK’s). OJAD and similar tools extend the utility of accent information to language teaching by making it interactive and accessible. General dictionaries include accent in a minimal way, usually consistent with NHK’s standard for common words, but not as detailed. UniDic and technical databases repurpose the knowledge for technology, essentially propagating NHK’s standard into NLP applications. Each resource differs in focus – whether on breadth vs. depth, prescriptive norm vs. descriptive reality, human learner vs. machine processing – but they all interrelate. Without NHK’s pioneering work to define and document standard accent, these other resources would lack a clear benchmark. Conversely, NHK’s dictionary benefits from the descriptive work of linguists (like Akinaga’s) to inform its updates. Users often consult multiple sources: for a thorough understanding, one might check NHK’s dict for the main accent, Shin Meikai for variant and historical info, and OJAD to hear it in context.
In summary, the NHK Accent Dictionary stands as the central pillar of Japanese pitch accent reference, with other dictionaries like Shin Meikai providing additional descriptive insights, and modern tools like OJAD and UniDic extending that knowledge into education and technology. Each differs in approach – NHK’s being normative and broadcast-oriented, Shin Meikai being encyclopedic and form-oriented, OJAD being pedagogical, and UniDic being computational – but they all share the goal of making the intricacies of Japanese pitch accent accessible and understandable to those who need it.

Footnotes:
[^1]: First edition publication: The initial NHK Japanese Accent Dictionary was compiled by NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) and published in 1943 (Showa 18). It was titled 「日本語アクセント辭典」 and published by the NHK Broadcasting Association. This was the first comprehensive attempt to catalog standard Japanese pitch accents for use in broadcasting[34]. The motivation was to unify pronunciation during the war era when clear communication was critical[4].
[^2]: Call for a standard accent: Kindaichi Haruhiko, in the foreword to the Meikai Japanese Accent Dictionary (1981), noted that dialectal differences in accent caused significant confusion. He pointed out that radio/TV Japanese could sound like multiple languages to foreigners, and even Japanese people felt the need for a “representative” standardized Japanese for the sake of communication[30][35]. This reflects why NHK’s effort in the 1940s to create a standard accent reference was broadly supported as a national linguistic goal.
[^3]: Size and content of 1943 edition: Precise details of the 1943 dictionary’s entry count vary, but references indicate it included on the order of ten thousand entries. For example, an analysis mentions that by 1966 the dictionary had about 30,000 entries (after expansion)[36], implying the 1943 version was smaller. The 1943 edition’s preface emphasizes how previous accent surveys/dictionaries were not thorough, and that this NHK compilation aimed to systematically document accent to facilitate its unification.
[^4]: NHK announcer accent survey: In 2008, NHK’s Broadcasting Culture Research Institute conducted a large-scale “Announcer Accent Survey” as part of the preparation for a new dictionary. They surveyed 3021 words with responses from 471 NHK announcers, achieving a 94% response rate[37][5]. The survey results, presented by researcher Yūdai Shioda, revealed misalignments between the dictionary’s norms and actual usage, directly influencing the revisions in the 2016 新辞典[21].
[^5]: Example – “trainer” accent change: NHK’s 1998 revised edition added the flat (heiban) accent pattern for 「トレーナー」 (“trainer” – clothing) as a primary accent, whereas the 1985 edition had only listed the atamadaka pattern (accent on the first mora “ト”). This change was based on survey data showing younger speakers and announcers increasingly used the flat pronunciation[8]. The inclusion signaled NHK’s acknowledgment of the accent flattening trend in loanwords.
[^6]: Multiple listed accents are all accepted: According to guidance and user discussions, when the NHK dictionary lists multiple accent patterns for a word, it considers all of them acceptable standard pronunciations. Typically the first is the most common or recommended at that time, but secondary ones are within the 許容 (allowable range)[6]. For example, 「納豆」 (nattō, fermented soybeans) might be listed with two patterns – both would be “correct” on NHK, even if one is marked as first preference.
[^7]: Accent variation in “ame” (rain vs candy): 「雨」 (ame, rain) and 「飴」 (ame, candy) are a classic minimal pair distinguished only by pitch accent. In standard Tokyo accent, 雨 is ア↘メ (HL, atamadaka – high then falling) and 飴 is アメ↗ (LH, heiban when isolated, realizing as a rise when a particle is attached)[38]. The NHK dictionary consistently upholds this distinction. However, some young speakers have begun saying 雨 with a flat pattern too, which potentially causes confusion. The 2016 NHK dictionary still keeps 雨 as atamadaka as the main pattern (given its importance in distinguishing meaning), though it might acknowledge the flattening in commentary. (The flattening trend more commonly affects words where no minimal pair is at stake.)
[^8]: 1985 edition information: The 1985 NHK Accent Dictionary (改訂新版) was edited by NHK’s Broadcast Culture Research Institute and published in Showa 60. It’s referenced often in linguistic literature and was widely used. For instance, a National Institute for Japanese Language Q&A in 2004 cites “the NHK accent dictionary 1985 edition had both meanings of ‘trainer’ accented on the first mora”[39]. The 1985 edition is notable for being the one that many current senior announcers learned from.
[^9]: 1998 edition description (Amazon): The Amazon Japan listing for NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典 新版 (1998) highlights: “Approximately 69,000 carefully selected words, centered on the accent most widely used in broadcasting. A revised edition of the dictionary that has been trusted since the first edition in Showa 18 (1943).”[13]. This confirms the word count and continuity of trust in the NHK accent standard over time.
[^10]: Entry counts and expansions: The exact number of entries in each edition isn’t always explicitly stated by NHK, but various sources give estimates. A 2016 article mentioned the new dictionary has about 75,000 headwords, which was 6,000 more than before[15]. Earlier, an NHK publication noted the 1998 edition had about 69,000 words[13]. By extrapolation and other references: the 1966 edition perhaps had around 30,000, and 1985 edition somewhere in between (maybe ~50k). Each edition incorporated new words reflecting the era’s needs (e.g., 1966 would have added many postwar loanwords and updated proper nouns, 1985 added high-growth era terminology and perhaps more scientific terms, 1998 added digital era words like “Internet”, and 2016 included 21st-century vernacular and global terms).
[^11]: Support rate examples (Shioda’s findings): The 2014 presentation by Shioda (NHK) gives concrete examples of mismatch between the old dictionary and announcer usage[21][40]. For instance, it lists words where the dictionary’s pattern had <10% support among announcers: 「アーメン」 (amen) accentless was listed, but apparently most announcers put an accent on “ア” (perhaps). Also, 「悪意」 (akui, malice) in dictionary vs how announcers say it differed. Conversely, words like 「ギャラ」 (gyara, guarantee fee for entertainers) were not listed as flat in the old dictionary, yet 100% of announcers in the survey pronounced it flat[41]. Such data underscored the need to update entries, which was done in 2016.
[^12]: Edition numbering: A Japanese source notes that the 2016 新辞典 is the 6th volume when counting from the first 1943 edition[15]. The five previous editions (or revisions) presumably are: 1943 (1st), 1960s revision (2nd, likely 1966), 1985 (3rd), 1998 (4th), and one more possibly unmentioned in the question (there might have been a minor update or interim version in the 1970s or early 90s considered a separate volume). However, NHK officially calls 2016 a “新辞典” rather than just another “新版,” indicating a major new edition rather than a minor revision.
[^13]: Counters appendix expansion: The 2016 edition’s appendix on counters (助数詞) is significantly expanded. According to an excerpt from NHK’s reports, one of the pillars of the revision was enhancing the appendices, the largest content being “数詞+助数詞の発音とアクセント” (pronunciation and accent of numerals + counters)[42]. This section provides guidance on phrases like 一匹, 二人, 十冊, etc., which are crucial in broadcast Japanese (e.g., reading out numbers). It’s an area where previous editions had limited info and many announcers had questions.
[^14]: Removal of rare counters: A paper on changes in counters in the 2016 dictionary notes the criteria for removing/adding entries in the counters appendix. It states: (i) counters not much used in modern life, (ii) those only used with very limited numbers, and (iii) those with no variation in reading/accent, were removed. In their place, counters found in a 2011 survey of usage were added[43]. For example, a very archaic counter might be dropped in favor of a modern one like 個 or ツ that needed more detail.
[^15]: Accent symbol change – user reactions: When the 2016 新辞典 came out, users on Twitter and blogs commented on the new accent notation. NHK’s own article notes “surprise at the change of accent symbols” was a common reaction[44]. The new edition replaced the old notation, which had a horizontal line or downstep mark, with a new marking system. Some examples of the new marking (shown in NHK’s PR materials) include a small lowered arrow or wedge before the point of drop. While ultimately clearer, it required users to get used to the new visual representation.
[^16]: Examples of words whose prescribed accent shifted: The phenomenon of 平板化 (heiban-ka, flattening) is documented in many words: - 「美人」 (bijin, beautiful woman) – Traditionally ビ↘ジン (HL). Now many say ビジン (flat). The NHK 2016 edition lists both, whereas older editions emphasized the HL pattern[45]. - 「かなり」 (kanari, fairly/quite) – Traditionally カ↘ナリ (HL). Younger speakers often say flat. NHK 2016 lists flat as well. - 「ビデオ」 (bideo, video) – Traditionally ビ↘デオ. Now equally ビデオ flat among many. Updated in 2016’s dictionary (flat included). - 「ピアノ」 (piano) – Originally ピ↘アノ. Now commonly flat ピアノ. The National Institute for Japanese Language reported that “ピアノ” and “アルバム” etc., which are currently flat, were originally accentual (had a drop)[46]. - 「ライオン」 (raion, lion) – Originally ライオ↘ン, now often ライオン flat; likewise updated. These changes have been confirmed by NHK’s surveys and incorporated, which sometimes causes older speakers to exclaim that “young people flatten everything these days!”
[^17]: Professional user voices (tweets/blogs): After the 2016 dictionary release, NHK collected feedback from professional announcers and voice actors on social media. Examples cited in NHK’s report include: - “Today is the day the Accent Dictionary, revised after 18 years, is released!!! New design and new accent symbols – can’t wait to get used to them!!” (Twitter, user excited for the new edition)[19]. - “The new Accent Dictionary – not only a must-have for professionals, but a strong ally for those of us from the countryside!! The pink sparkle is lovely.” (Twitter, user twi-2)[47]. - “Announcer colleagues one after another getting the New Accent Dictionary! I got mine – an announcer’s indispensable seven tools, this is one of them!!” (Instagram post)[48]. These illustrate the generally positive reception among its core user base.
