## Old Japanese (上代日本語, pre-794) – Nara Period Evidence
Old Japanese of the Nara period had a pitch-accent system, though it was rarely marked in writing. Scholars have deduced its nature by analyzing texts like the Man’yōshū and Nihon Shoki. Notably, one section of the Nihon Shoki (720 CE) uses Chinese characters with specific tone categories to hint at Japanese pitch patterns: characters with a Middle Chinese “level” tone were chosen to represent low-pitched syllables, while characters with other tones represented high pitch[1]. This clever use of Chinese tone marks suggests that Late Nara–period Japanese had two pitch levels (high vs. low) arranged in patterns similar to those later recorded in Heian-era sources[1]. In other words, Old Japanese accent was likely very similar to Early Middle Japanese accent, with certain syllables pronounced in a higher pitch relative to others in a word.
Another line of evidence comes from the Man’yōshū’s orthography. Linguists discovered the phenomenon of Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai (“Ancient Special Kana Orthography”), where the spelling distinguishes so-called Type A vs. Type B vowels (traditionally called kō-rui 甲類 and otsu-rui 乙類). In 8th-century texts, certain vowels (notably /i/, /e/, /o/) were written with two different sets of kana, implying a subtle quality difference. For example, Old Japanese had eight vowels where later Japanese has five[2]. These Type A/B vowel distinctions – sometimes marked with subscripts like i₁, i₂ – disappeared by the early Heian period as the vowel categories merged[2]. Scholars have debated the relationship between this vowel distinction and pitch accent. One hypothesis was that Type A vs. B might correlate with different accent classes (since many minimal pairs distinguished by A/B vowels later became homophones). However, no direct evidence in the texts ties vowel type to pitch – it appears the kō/otsu vowel distinction was an independent phonological feature that did not itself mark high vs. low pitch. By Early Middle Japanese, those vowel differences had merged without obliterating the accent system, indicating that pitch accent survived the vowel merger[2]. Thus, we infer that Nara-period Japanese had a two-level pitch accent much like the Heian system, even though the writing system did not explicitly show accent except in a few experimental cases.
Primary sources and reconstruction: Because direct notation of accent is scarce in Nara writings, scholars rely on later records and comparative methods to reconstruct Old Japanese accent. The continuity from Nara into Heian is supported by the fact that Heian-era dictionaries describe accent in detail (see below), and there is no sign of a radical accent overhaul between the 8th and 9th centuries. We can say with some confidence that an Old Japanese word’s accent class was the same as in Early Middle Japanese[1]. The Man’yōshū’s poetry and phonological patterns (like where sound changes such as contraction occurred) also indirectly support the existence of specific accent patterns, since certain metric or euphonic phenomena make sense only if some syllables were low-pitched. In sum, although the Nara-period accent must be reconstructed, it appears to have been a two-tone, pitch-accent system similar to that of the following Heian age[1].
## Middle Japanese (中古日本語, 794–1185) – Heian Kyoto Accent
During the Heian period, the Kyōto court dialect was the prestige standard, and fortunately we have explicit documentation of its pitch accent. The key source is the Ruiju Myōgishō (類聚名義抄, late 11th century), a Heian dictionary which notated the accent of Japanese words using a system of small marks called shōten (“tone points”)[3]. This dictionary, compiled by learned monks, lists over 10,000 Japanese readings of words and indicates their accent class by using Chinese-style tone symbols[3]. For example, a low-pitch syllable in Japanese might be marked with the Chinese level-tone dot, and a high-pitch syllable with a rising/going-tone dot[1]. Such notation reveals exactly which mora carried the pitch drop in each word. Heian Japanese accent was thus well-documented and appears to have been a fully developed pitch-accent system with multiple contrastive patterns.
How many accent classes existed? Later analysis by linguists (notably Hattori Shiro and Kindaichi Haruhiko) concluded that Heian-era Japanese distinguished up to five accent classes for two-mora (bisyllabic) words[4][5], and even more for longer words. In practical terms, this means that for a word of two syllables (say CV.CV structure), there were five possible pitch patterns in the language, and each word fell into one of those patterns. Likewise, three-mora words had up to 9 distinct accent patterns in some reconstructions[4]. These classes are often labeled with numbers in modern scholarship. For instance, a common scheme (based on later dialect comparisons) labels noun accent classes as “Type 1”, “Type 2”, etc., sometimes with subdivisions (e.g. 2.1, 2.2, etc.). The important point is that Heian Japanese allowed a rich variety of pitch contours, more than modern Tokyo Japanese does. In modern Standard Japanese, a given word has at most one accented high-to-low drop (or none, if it’s heiban), but in Heian Japanese the placement of that drop could vary in more intricate ways. Some linguists describe the Heian system as a “full” tone system, meaning every word had a specific tonal pattern (much like how Mandarin Chinese has tone patterns for syllables), though Japanese tones were only high vs. low and linked to accent position rather than syllable-intrinsic tones.
To illustrate, the Ruiju Myōgishō provides accent-marked forms of verbs and nouns. For example, it records the verb oku (置く, “to put”) in various inflected forms with tone marks. Modern researchers (e.g. Samuel Martin) have extracted these: in the citation form (終止形) “oku” was marked low–low (no accent drop), but in the conjunctive form “okite” it was marked low–high–low (indicating a high pitch on the second mora followed by a drop)[6]. In another variation “oite” (with phonological contraction), the dictionary shows low–high–high[6]. These detailed notations tell us that the same verb had different accent in different forms, which is a crucial clue – Japanese accent could shift with inflection even in Heian times. Overall, the Kyoto accent of the 11th century appears to have been a register tone system: every content word had an inherent accent pattern defined by where the first drop occurred (or if it never dropped, in which case the word was high until the end). There was still a binary pitch (H vs L), but the patterns were numerous because a drop could occur at various positions or not at all. In fact, one analysis holds that the Heian system had three basic melodies (H-L, L-H, and L-H-L sequences), combining to produce multiple classes[7][8]. The Kyoto court Japanese of this era is sometimes referred to as the “Keihan” accent type, which modern Kansai dialects are descendants of.
Key sources and reconstruction: The Ruiju Myōgishō remains a primary source for Heian accent[3]. It, along with similar texts (like poetic tone patterns noted in waka poetry), allows scholars to reconstruct how many classes existed. Hattori (1930s) initially posited five classes for disyllabic words[4], later refined to specific patterns for words of different lengths. Impressively, some present-day dialects still preserve an ancient distinction: for example, Ibuki Island (in the Kansai region) is cited for maintaining five separate accent classes for two-syllable nouns – no other modern dialect does this[5]. This suggests Ibuki Island’s accent is an archaic relic, preserving the full Heian-era system. Such findings across dialects, combined with the dictionary tone marks, allow us to reconstruct the accent classes of Middle Japanese with a high degree of confidence. In summary, Middle Japanese (Heian Kyoto) had a complex pitch-accent system where every word fell into a particular tonal class, and this system is directly recorded by Heian scholars[3].
## Late Middle Japanese (中世日本語, 1185–1600) – Medieval Shift from Kyōto to Edo
Late Middle Japanese spans the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, during which political power shifted geographically. The Kamakura shogunate (1185–1333) saw the samurai government in eastern Japan, and later the Muromachi/Ashikaga shogunate (1336–1573) was back in Kyōto. Culturally, Kyōto’s dialect remained influential through much of this era, but by the end of the 16th century the stage was set for Edo (modern Tokyo) to become dominant. This period is crucial for accent history because regional accent divergence accelerated: the pitch accent of Eastern Japan began to depart significantly from the Kyōto (Western) pattern.
European missionaries who arrived in Japan in the late 1500s provide an outsider’s glimpse of Japanese pronunciation at the end of the Middle Japanese period. Portuguese Jesuits, notably João Rodrigues, studied Japanese diligently and even wrote grammars. Rodrigues’s Arte da Lingoa de Iapam (1604–1608) is the oldest extant Japanese grammar by a Westerner[9] and includes observations on pronunciation and accent. He recognized that Japanese was not accented by stress like European languages, but by pitch differences. In fact, he described something analogous to the Greek or Latin notion of accentus: a musical high tone that can occur in words. While Rodrigues’s grammar uses Latin grammatical terms, he notes how Japanese words have different “tones” or accentuation patterns. For example, later analysts of his work found that he sometimes marked Japanese words with an acute (´) or grave (`) accent in romanization to indicate high vs. low pitches (though the system was not as fully developed as later native studies). The mere fact that Rodrigues felt the need to discuss accent shows that the pitch accent was a salient feature of Japanese in 1600[9]. Additionally, missionary dictionaries like Vocabvlario da Lingoa de Iapam (1603) occasionally noted when two words differed only by pitch accent, implying foreigners had become aware of minimal pairs distinguished by tone.
It’s during Late Middle Japanese that we start to see shifts in accent patterns between regions. Traditional Japanese scholarship long held that Kyōto’s accent was conservative and that the Edo (Eastern) accent underwent changes. According to this view (advocated by linguist Kindaichi Haruhiko among others), the Tokyo/Edo-type accent diverged from the Kyōto-type during the medieval period via a “rightward shift.” This means the position of the accent kernel (the high-to-low drop) moved towards later syllables or was lost entirely in many words[10][11]. Kindaichi concluded that the tone system of Middle Japanese resembled that of modern Kyōto, and that as Eastern dialects (precursors of Tokyo) evolved, they shifted the accent one syllable to the right (later in the word), simplifying some of the patterns[10][12]. He even pinpointed the Kamakura period (1185–1333) as a likely time for this shift[10]. Under this model, the prestige Kyōto dialect of the 12th–13th centuries kept the complex multi-class accent, while outlying areas (East and North) began merging or flattening some distinctions.
However, there is a competing theory that flips this narrative. S. Robert Ramsey (1979) proposed that it was actually Kyōto’s accent that innovated (via a leftward shift) after the Middle Japanese period, and that the simpler “Tokyo-type” accent found widely in Japan is closer to the original pattern[13][14]. In other words, Ramsey argues the standard interpretation of historical tone marks had been “upside-down” – if one reinterprets them, Middle Japanese accent looks like a more complex version of Tokyo’s system[14]. Then, in the centuries after 1200, central Japan underwent a leftward High-tone shift (moving the high-pitch portion to earlier in words), resulting in the modern Kansai (Kyōto–Ōsaka) accent where many words begin high and drop early[14]. This leftward shift in the Kyoto area would be analogous to certain tone changes seen in other languages (Ramsey likened it to developments in some Bantu languages)[15]. Under this view, the Edo/Tokyo accent wasn’t a radical departure but rather the main line of descent from the older accent, only reduced in complexity. It was the Kyoto dialect that “flipped” some tone patterns later. This hypothesis was controversial in Japan, as it challenged a longstanding belief that Kyoto speech preserved classical features[16][17]. In recent years, research by Elisabeth de Boer has provided strong support for Ramsey’s perspective, arguing it better fits typological evidence and the geographic spread of accent systems[18][14]. In summary, Late Middle Japanese is the pivot point of two interpretations: one sees Eastern Japan simplifying an originally Kyoto-like system, the other sees Kyoto innovating away from an originally simpler system.
What did contemporary observers note about accents around 1600? European records don’t explicitly spell out the theory of shifts, but they do mention dialect differences. For instance, later Jesuit reports commented that the Japanese of Kyūshū vs. the capital vs. the east sounded different in intonation. In 1603, one missionary noted that the Japanese language “sings” in different ways in different provinces. This likely alludes to pitch accent differences (though they lacked the linguistic terminology to explain it fully). By the early 17th century, Edo (Tokyo) was emerging as a new center, yet Kyoto’s cultural prestige still loomed large. This dynamic set the stage for the next phase, where Edo Japanese would take over as the standard.
## Early Modern Japanese (近世日本語, 1600–1868) – The Rise of Edo and Diversification
The Early Modern period (Edo period) marks the shift of the cultural and political capital to Edo (Tokyo) and, eventually, the divergence of Edo’s speech norms from the old Kyoto norms. When Tokugawa Ieyasu established his shogunate in Edo (1603), the region’s dialect was considered rough by the standards of the court in Kyoto. Over the next two and a half centuries of Tokugawa rule, Edo grew into a metropolis, attracting people from all over Japan. This likely led to some dialect leveling in Edo itself – a new Edo koine accent formed, predominantly based on Eastern Japanese speech (which already had a simpler pitch pattern).
When and how did Tokyo-type accent diverge from Kyoto-type? If one follows Kindaichi’s traditional model, much of the divergence had already occurred by the Edo period (perhaps during Kamakura times). Thus by 1600, the Edo dialect had a Tokyo-style accent: typically only one drop or none in a word, often later in the word (e.g. words that Kyoto pronounces with an early drop were pronounced with a late drop or flat in Edo). Historical anecdotes support this – Edo people sometimes found Kyoto speech melodic or singsong, and Kyoto people in turn found Edo speech “monotonous.” This reflects the fact that Kyoto dialect retained more of the old highs and lows, whereas Edo dialect was more uniform except for a single drop. If instead we consider Ramsey’s theory, Edo’s accent in 1600 was conservative (close to the original), and Kyoto’s had recently undergone change. In either case, by the 17th–18th century the two cities had noticeably different accent systems. For example, a certain word that Kyoto people pronounced with a high start and drop (H(L)… pattern) might be pronounced with an initial low and no drop (L…H) in Edo – essentially the opposite pattern. This situation gave rise to many accent “doublets” between Kamigata (Kansai) speech and Edo speech.
One concrete milestone in accent divergence was the “Edo Hanenari” phenomenon, recorded in late Edo-period linguistic commentary. Hanenari refers to certain words whose accent in Edo differed from Kyoto’s in a systematic way – scholars of the time noted these correspondences. This shows that intellectuals in the late Edo period were aware of accent differences as a regional characteristic. By the end of the Edo era, the Tokyo-type (also called “Tokyo two-pattern”) accent had fully formed. It’s called two-pattern because for any given word length, a word was either accented (one specific downstep somewhere) or unaccented (no downstep, effectively high until the end). Tokyo Japanese no longer preserved all the multiple classes of the Heian period; many of those classes had merged into either “has an accent drop” or “has none” for a given length, greatly simplifying the system (though still not entirely losing contrast). Meanwhile, Kyoto (and the Kansai region) kept a richer system with more possible drop positions.
Beyond Edo and Kyoto, the Early Modern era saw regional diversification of accent systems across Japan. The long peace and stability of the Tokugawa years meant limited population movement between far-flung domains. Each region’s speech habits, including accent, had time to solidify in relative isolation. For instance, Kagoshima (Satsuma domain in southern Kyūshū) evolved a very distinct prosody. Satsuma’s accent became so different that it was essentially unintelligible to people from elsewhere, not just for its segmental dialect but its intonation. Similarly, northern Japan (Tohoku), with its own isolated communities, developed accents that deviated strongly from the Kyoto standard.
It’s worth noting that within the Edo period, Kyoto’s prestige as the cultural capital persisted. Samurai and educated people in Edo were often bilingual in a sense – they would use some Kyoto-style pronunciations (including perhaps accent) for elegance, especially in poetry or traditional arts. However, by the closing years of Tokugawa rule, Edo’s own dialect was gaining social clout as the voice of the shogunate and the vibrant commoner culture (e.g. kabuki theater in Edo often featured characters speaking in Edo dialect versus Kyōto dialect for contrast). This laid the groundwork for Meiji-era standardization, where ultimately the Tokyo accent would win out as “standard Japanese.”
In summary, Early Modern Japanese accent evolution is characterized by Tokyo (Edo) solidifying its simpler accent pattern distinct from Kyoto’s, and by various regions cementing their own accent changes. By 1868, Japan’s linguistic landscape was a patchwork of accent types – from the Kyoto multi-pattern system to the Tokyo one-pattern, to places with almost no lexical accent at all. The stage was set for one to be chosen as the national standard, which came with the dawn of the modern era.
## Modern Japanese (近代日本語, 1868–Present) – Standardization and NHK Era
With the Meiji Restoration (1868) and the establishment of a modern nation-state, there was a conscious push to create a standard Japanese (標準語) for education, media, and government. The Tokyo dialect, specifically the speech of educated Tokyoites (many of whom were former samurai from various domains but converging to Tokyo norms), became the base of this standard. One reason was practical: Tokyo was the seat of government and the center of new institutions. Additionally, the Tokyo accent’s relative simplicity was seen as advantageous – it had fewer categories to master than, say, the Kyoto system.
In the late 19th century, Japanese linguists and lexicographers began explicitly codifying Tokyo pitch accent. For example, in 1893 Yamada Bimyō published a dictionary (Nihon Daijisho) that marked every headword with its Tokyo pitch accent pattern – using a two-level notation for high (H) and low (L) pitch[19]. This was an early attempt to teach and standardize the accent. Yamada’s system essentially acknowledged two tones, and every word was annotated accordingly, which reflects the two-pattern nature of Tokyo accent[19]. Interestingly, it’s noted that Yamada’s use of just two symbols might have been more for convenience than a phonetically rigorous analysis[19], but it shows the trend: Meiji-era scholars were keenly aware of accent as a national linguistic feature to be systematized.
In the 20th century, especially with the rise of radio and later television, the influence of Tokyo accent as “standard Japanese” became pervasive. The public broadcaster NHK (founded in 1925) played a pivotal role. NHK established an Pronunciation Accent Guidelines Committee, and announcers were trained to speak in a uniform Tokyo accent. In 1943, during World War II, an authoritative Accent Dictionary was published (often attributed to NHK or related linguists) to codify the standard accent for broadcasting and schooling. This 1943 accent dictionary (日本語発音アクセント辞典) listed words with their prescribed accent (downstep position or lack thereof), effectively freezing the Tokyo dialect’s norms into a national standard. Subsequent accent dictionaries and manuals, such as those revised in the postwar period (1950s and beyond, e.g. the Shin Meikai Accent Dictionary and NHK’s own editions), have continued to refine these standards as the language evolves. These resources ensure that newscasters, teachers, and students share a common accent model. The effort has been quite successful – today, most educated Japanese are familiar with the “NHK accent” pattern and can modify their speech towards it when needed.
The role of NHK broadcasting cannot be overstated. By transmitting the Tokyo standard nation-wide, it gradually eroded the stigma or unfamiliarity of the Tokyo accent in other regions. By the mid-20th century, younger generations across Japan were increasingly bilingual in terms of accent: they spoke their local accent at home, but could understand and often produce the standard accent from school and media exposure. This phenomenon is analogous to, say, the spread of Received Pronunciation in the UK via the BBC. Importantly, standardization efforts targeted not just vocabulary and grammar, but explicitly pitch accent, which was taught as part of correct pronunciation. School curriculum incorporated standard accent for words (though not all teachers emphasized it, students in the early 1900s learned the Tokyo accent as the “correct” way to speak). By the post-WWII era, pitch accent was included in linguistic research and education – for instance, the 1943 accent dictionary and its successors (like the 1960s NHK Accent Dictionary) became reference books for proper speech in theater, broadcasting, and academia.
One interesting aspect of modern standardization is that it sometimes involved conscious compromise or influence from other dialects. While Tokyo accent was the base, a few idiosyncratic Tokyo patterns were “regularized.” For example, Tokyo dialect historically had some word pairs where accent could vary among Tokyo natives themselves; the standard chose one pattern for consistency. In rare cases, a non-Tokyo pronunciation was adopted if the Tokyo one was deemed too colloquial. But overwhelmingly, Standard Japanese = Tokyo Yamanote dialect accent as spoken by the upper-class Tokyo residents of the late 19th century.
The National Language Research Institute and scholars like Kindaichi Haruhiko continued to publish on accent. Kindaichi himself (grandson of a famous dialectologist) wrote general audience books explaining standard accent and regional differences, fostering public awareness. By the 1980s, NHK’s broadcasting guidelines were so influential that many Japanese could, for example, discern a news announcer’s slight regional accent and there was pressure to conform to the “correct” pitch accent on every word. To this day, NHK periodically updates its accent dictionary (the most recent editions reflect a few changes in tokutei-go preferred accent in Tokyo speech, as language always changes).
In sum, the modern period took the Tokyo pitch-accent system, elevated it to nationwide status, and through dictionaries (1943 and later) and broadcasting, standardized Japanese pitch accent like never before in history. The result is that despite Japan’s great dialect diversity, there is a widely recognized standard accent pattern for formal speech[19]. This doesn’t mean everyone speaks standard accent all the time – but it serves as a common reference, much as standard spelling does.
## Dialectal Divergence and Geographic Distribution of Accent Systems
One of the most fascinating aspects of Japanese pitch accent is its dialectal variation. Over the centuries, different regions developed distinct accent systems – some simplifying the old patterns, others preserving or complicating them. Today, Japanese dialects are often classified by accent type: Tokyo-type (one-drop) vs. Keihan-type (multi-drop), and also “accentless” types. Why did some regions lose lexical pitch distinctions entirely, while others kept very complex systems?
Kagoshima (Satsuma) in southern Kyūshū is a prime example of an extreme outcome. Kagoshima Japanese has often been described as having no lexical accent, or as a two-pattern system at most[20]. In Kagoshima’s accent (and the similar Makurazaki dialect nearby), essentially every word falls into one of two categories: accented or unaccented. An “accented” word will have one specific syllable with a drop after it, and an “unaccented” word will have a flat or gently falling intonation with no clear drop until perhaps a following particle. For instance, in the Makurazaki dialect, hana “nose” is accented: it’s pronounced Low then High (L-H) on its two syllables, with a fall in pitch immediately after the word[21]. In contrast, hana “flower” is unaccented: it’s pronounced High then “Mid” (H-M) with no drop, or essentially a slight fall at the very end[21]. These patterns show that Kagoshima words are not distinguished by multiple possible accent kernels – only by “has a drop before the last syllable” vs “no drop until the end.” The difference is so subtle that in isolation “nose” vs “flower” might sound almost the same; only when a particle is attached (e.g. hana ga) does the distinction become clear (accented “nose” would cause ga to start low, unaccented “flower” would keep ga high). Effectively, Kagoshima has neutralized most of the accent classes found in other dialects. This is why Kagoshima people rely more on context and grammar to distinguish homophones, as pitch gives fewer clues.
Moving to the far north, parts of Tōhoku (northern Honshū) have what is called a “zero-pattern” or accentless dialect. For example, much of Aomori and Akita prefectures exhibit this: every syllable in a word is pronounced with about the same level pitch (perhaps a slight rise and fall over the phrase, but no specific lexical distinction). These speakers don’t use pitch to differentiate word meaning at all – a drastic contrast to Tokyo or Kyoto speech. Linguists call this a “flat accent” or hei-otsu akusento (literally “even accent, none falling”). If you listen to such dialects, the intonation sounds very flat or drawn out until a final drop at the end of a sentence. An example is the Nanbu dialect around Morioka: traditionally, it’s often described as having no accent contrast (though some micro-variations exist). Likewise, Hokkaidō’s dialect was heavily influenced by Tōhoku settlers in the 19th century, so many areas of Hokkaidō also have an accentless quality (except cities like Sapporo where standard Japanese is now common).
Contrast these with Kansai region (Kyōto–Ōsaka). Kansai Japanese retains a complex, multi-class accent system (the Keihan type). In Kyōto or Ōsaka today, a word can have the accent drop in various positions – effectively a carryover of the old system, though somewhat simplified from Heian times. Modern Kyōto accent is often analyzed as having two “patterns” for each length (so it distinguishes fewer classes than ancient Kyōto). For example, for 3-mora words Kansai dialect might allow three patterns (H-H-L, L-H-H, H-L-H, etc.), whereas Tokyo only has two (either L-H-L or L-H-H, since Tokyo words can’t start high unless accented on the first syllable). This means Kansai people can distinguish words by accent that Tokyo people cannot. A classic example: ame – in Tokyo, ame (rain) vs ame (candy) are distinguished (rain is HL, candy is LH in Tokyo), but Tokyo has only those two patterns. In Osaka, I believe ame “rain” and “candy” not only differ, but there might be additional nouns of that shape that have a third pattern. Indeed, the Kansai system is sometimes described as having a “three-way contrast” for some 2-syllable words[22], whereas Tokyo has a two-way. (In technical terms, Tokyo 2-mora nouns can be either accented on the first, accented on second, or unaccented – effectively three possibilities, but accented-on-second and unaccented sound the same in isolation so it’s a two-way phonemic distinction; Kyoto/Osaka historically had up to four possibilities for 2-mora nouns, a three-way phonemic contrast when considering particle behavior.)
So why did some regions lose pitch accent and others not? Linguists have proposed several factors:
Geographic and historical isolation: Peripheral areas like Kagoshima and Tōhoku, at the extremes of the archipelago, were less influenced by the prestige Kyoto norm during critical periods. They may have continued along their own path of accent evolution unchecked. Yanagita Kunio, a famed folklorist, once characterized Japanese dialects as distributed in concentric rings: the idea is that innovations often start in the center (Kyōto) and spread outward, but sometimes the center innovates differently or faster, leaving old features in outer regions. In accent terms, central Japan ended up with either Kyoto-type or Tokyo-type patterns (both of which preserve a lexical pitch contrast), whereas the far north and far south underwent extreme tone reduction – perhaps because they did not fully participate in intermediate changes.
Tone reduction and merger: As mentioned earlier, after the Middle Japanese period there was a general simplification of tone patterns in many dialects[23][24]. According to de Boer’s analysis, all dialects underwent a “radical tone reduction” where complex tone sequences simplified to basically a single High pitch followed by Low (HL) pattern[25]. This would mean the only surviving contrast from the old days was whether a word had a HL drop or not. In some dialects, even that contrast eroded in certain environments. The outer-circle dialects (外輪方言, gairin) – typically northern Tōhoku and parts of Kyūshū – appear to have lost the HL drop in many words entirely[26]. In those regions, formerly accented words became indistinguishable from unaccented ones, yielding an accentless system. For example, if proto-Japanese had a class with a late HL drop (say on the last syllable) vs. a truly unaccented class, an outer dialect might have merged both as no drop (level). Kagoshima is often cited: historically it likely had a two-pattern accent (still a contrast), but in practice the realization is so subtle that it mimics an accentless system. In linguistic terms, certain accent classes “lost their pitch fall and became unaccented” in the outer regions[26].
Morphological factors: In Kagoshima, one interesting factor is that particles attach in a prosodically different way. The dialect treats particles as clitics that fuse onto the word, sometimes causing what would be a drop to shift or not materialize[27][28]. For instance, if every content word is uttered phrase-finally with a drop at the very end (or none), then in continuous speech you rarely hear a contrast within the word itself. Over time, this could lead to speakers not phonologizing those differences. In essence, the domain of accent shifted: rather than each word having an independent accent, an entire phrase (word+particle) had a single accent contour. Kagoshima took this to an extreme, leveling differences within the phrase. This clitic behavior might explain how Kagoshima ended up with only a binary distinction. In Tōhoku, other phonological changes (like vowel devoicing, vowel length patterns, etc.) might have contributed to making pitch less salient, allowing it to drift towards a flat contour.
Retention of older features: Conversely, why did Kansai keep a complex system? Possibly because the Kansai region (Kinai) was the cultural heart for so long that it kept the older distinctions out of conservatism or because changes that happened there moved in a different direction (Kyoto’s leftward tone shift created new distinctions even as it merged others). In fact, Kyoto-type dialects (inner circle, 内輪) tend to preserve distinctions like the difference between accent classes 2.5 vs 3.7 (technical labels) which most other dialects merged[29]. Some very conservative spots (like Ibuki Island as noted) even preserve things no one else does[5]. This suggests the Kansai area innovated less in terms of merging accent classes – they did shift patterns (the leftward shift making words begin low where they once began high, etc.), but they did not collapse everything into accent vs no-accent.
The geographic distribution today is indeed striking: Most of Kantō (Tokyo region) and westward through Chūbu and much of Kyūshū have a Tokyo-type system (one drop or none per word). Kansai and Shikoku have Kyoto-type systems (often described as “Keihan” accent), which allow multiple drops or a more complex pattern in a word. Far north (Aomori, Iwate) and far south (southern Kyūshū, e.g. Kagoshima) have accentless or minimal systems. Linguists have mapped these, noting a kind of central vs. peripheral split[26]. Historically this might align with migrations and influence: the Yamato expansion from the Kansai might have spread an accent system to surrounding regions, but at the extremes (Tohoku frontier, Satsuma domain) the accent either didn’t fully take or later drifted due to isolation.
Lastly, the Ryukyuan languages (Okinawa and neighboring islands) deserve mention as part of the puzzle. The Ryukyuan branch split from Mainland Japanese perhaps over a millennium ago (some say as early as 7th century or so). Many Ryukyuan languages have their own pitch accent systems, and these often mirror what we think Proto-Japonic accent looked like. For example, Shuri Okinawan (the old capital of the Ryukyu Kingdom) has a two-pattern accent system somewhat like Tokyo’s, but with differences that align with certain ancient Japanese classes. Some Ryukyuan dialects have more than two patterns. Linguists comparing Japanese and Ryukyuan have identified correspondences – e.g. a Proto-Japonic accent class can be inferred if a given word is accented in Tokyo but not in Shuri, or vice versa. Indeed, by comparing multiple Ryukyuan and Japanese dialects, scholars reconstruct Proto-Japonic as having at least two (maybe three) tone classes for nouns. These would have given rise to the various systems we see: Tokyo-type being one conservative outcome, Kyoto-type representing a shifted outcome, and accentless being an innovative loss. The Ryukyuan evidence often supports Ramsey’s idea that Tokyo-type (one-drop) might be closer to original. For instance, in one analysis Proto-Japonic had a pattern where some words were accented on the first syllable (H…L pattern) and others were not (no drop or late drop). Modern Tokyo preserves a distinction (first-syllable vs unaccented) which corresponds neatly, whereas Kyoto transformed the first-syllable accent words into a different pattern (initial low with a drop later). Without going too deep into technicalities, the Ryukyuan pitch systems confirm that the ancestor of Japanese did use pitch accent to distinguish words, rather than Ryukyuan developing it independently. This adds weight to the notion that pitch accent is an inherited feature of Japonic, not a later innovation.
In summary, dialectal differences in pitch accent arose from a combination of historic shifts and reductions. Central dialects like Kyoto and Tokyo kept pitch accent but altered its alignment (each in their own way), while peripheral dialects often underwent accent neutralization. Kagoshima and parts of Tōhoku ended up with nearly monotonic word intonation (losing lexical tone contrasts) through extreme reduction[26]. Kansai retained a rich system by preserving multiple classes and undergoing a different shift (leftward tone movement rather than loss)[14]. The present geographic distribution – with “no accent” areas at the extremes and complex accent in the historical center – reflects these historical processes and supports theories of how Proto-Japonic accent evolved across the islands. It’s a brilliant demonstration of how a single original accent system can blossom into diverse forms under different linguistic and social conditions, leaving us with a living tapestry of pitch-accent variations across Japan[30][26].
